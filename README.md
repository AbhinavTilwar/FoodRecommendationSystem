## About the App

The Food Recommendation System is a web app built using Streamlit. It recommends dishes based on the ingredients you input. It utilises a cosine similarity algorithm to find dishes with matching ingredients from a dataset of recipes.

### Frontend

The app's frontend is designed with a custom HTML template to provide an appealing and user-friendly interface. It features a title and an image of food to enhance the user experience.

### Data Source

The app uses a dataset titled "Food Ingredients and Recipe Dataset with Image Name Mapping," which contains recipes' titles and cleaned ingredients. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images).


## How to Use

1. Visit the [Food Recommendation System](https://foodrecommendationsystem.streamlit.app) website.
2. Enter the ingredients you would like to use in the text input field. Separate the ingredients with commas.
3. Click the “Recommend” button to get a list of recommended dishes based on your input.
4. Each recommended dish is expandable, so you can click on it to view the list of ingredients required for that dish.
5. Explore and find a delicious dish to enjoy!
