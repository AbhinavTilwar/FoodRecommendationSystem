## About the App

The Food Recommendation System is a web app built using Streamlit. It recommends dishes based on the ingredients you input. It utilises a cosine similarity algorithm to find dishes with matching ingredients from a dataset of recipes.

### Frontend

The app's frontend is designed with a custom HTML template to provide an appealing and user-friendly interface. It features a title and an image of food to enhance the user experience.

### Data Source

The app uses a dataset titled "Food Ingredients and Recipe Dataset with Image Name Mapping," which contains recipes' titles and cleaned ingredients. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pes12017000148/food-ingredients-and-recipe-dataset-with-images).
